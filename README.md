![Dashboard]("dashboard.png")
- What is the Berlin marathon?
    - The Berlin marathon is a global marathon held yearly in Berlin, Germany since 1974. The dataset in used includes running times since the marathon's inception, and we delve into how some trends in running speeds have changed over time, and what factors play into lower running times.
- How have the average/fastest times changed over the years?
    - The top left graph shows that the average running times have increased over the years, likely due to an increase in the interest in the running community. The final running times, however, have decrease, given the increased number of challengers.
- How does age and gender affect running times
    - In the bottom left, we can see that women are overall slower than men by 30 minutes on average. In terms of age (the graph can be viewed in the dropdown), the peak running times occur around 30 years.
- Where are most runners from? Where are the fastest from. 
    - Given that this event takes place in Berlin, most runners are from Germany. The fastest runners are from Kenya, Ethiopia. As studies have now shown, this is due to strong genetics and high-altitude training.
